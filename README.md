**Rating System**

**B1ST** allows advanced rating system where users can vote for each answer they receive as a reply from Admins. This helps a lot with the aid of Admin-Status where admin can check his average rating he received with regard to overall rating received from all other Admins.  

Also, an Admin can check how many bad rates he received (based on rating settings) 

- Average Rating

**Auto-Respond Message**

B1ST can be configured to respond automatically to each message received on your message board; thus, customers make sure their messages are delivered to you. Additionally, you may leave them a message when they should receive a reply from you and your team's work hours & days off.

**grAvatar**

Show you and your customer's grAvatar next to each message and their replies; that makes sense. Thus, you are a globally recognized avatar.
